# Lof_Frontend2FA

This extension is based on [Neyamtux_Authenticator](https://github.com/juashyam/2-Factor-Authentication/), which offers 2FA for the backend.

## Features
- Ability to force frontend 2FA for specific customer groups;
- 2FA is enforced for chosen customer groups meaning the customer has to either setup or authenticate before continuing after logging in;
- All customers in any group can optionally set their own 2FA;
- Open the customer in the backend to be able to reset the 2FA secret;
- Dutch translation files.

## Installation

```
composer require lof/frontend2fa
php bin/magento module:enable Lof_Frontend2FA
php bin/magento module:enable Neyamtux_Authenticator
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## Integration with other authentication systems

To bypass the 2FA requirement for a specific logged in user, for example if you are using a Single Sign-On system for certain users,
set this value in their customer session:


```
$customerSession->set2faSuccessful(true);
```
